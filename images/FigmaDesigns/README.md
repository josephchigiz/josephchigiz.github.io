# Figma Designs üé®
- I have had fun in Figma while trying to put some life into my projectsü§î - playing around with elements, positioning, colors, and typographyüìù.  
- The first design, being a simple web portfolio layout I designed before realizing it was quite complexü§Ø for me to code it at the time and <br>ending up with several different iterations afterward.  
- Here is a list of some of the Figma designs I have come up with so far:
  1. First, the three iterations of my web portfolio and the final one:üñ•Ô∏è  
    a. The first idea of my [web portfolio](https://www.figma.com/file/h3RcmrfQy83K5Vx162CzZj/Portfolio(First-Iteration)?type=design&t=T0iGxZzL2s8plDYJ-6)
    b. The [second iteration](https://www.figma.com/file/DEaukgKHsSLf1de1YZh47G/PF-Iteration2?type=design&t=T0iGxZzL2s8plDYJ-6)
    c. The [third iteration](https://www.figma.com/file/kOLQJQyx6S7uQGZ5ogcYLf/PF-Iteration3?type=design&t=T0iGxZzL2s8plDYJ-6) changing the position of my profile.
    d. The [final portfolio design](https://www.figma.com/file/gHzxLNnYLitTFEQPQl8MB8/MyPortfolio?type=design&t=T0iGxZzL2s8plDYJ-6) that was implemented.
